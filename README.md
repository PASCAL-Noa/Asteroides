# About 

☄️ Asteroides – My first C++ project ! ⚡

Asteroids is my very first project in C++ and also my first experience with SFML. Created through a 9-hour Udemy course, this project allowed me to prepare for my academic year while learning how to set up a project with SFML and use external libraries.

The gameplay is simple: the player controls a spaceship that must shoot at asteroids. If the spaceship collides with one, the game is lost.

# Build the solution 
1. Clone the repository
2. Download and install [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git)
4. Go to ./bin
5. Run `make.bat`
6. Run the Breakout.sln
